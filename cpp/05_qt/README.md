# Qt Basics

* Qt is a framework for C++ that started as a GUI library but has become much, much more.
    * it has networking functionality, a [reimplementation of the STL](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/containers.html),
    3D graphics with OpenGL, access to smartphone peripherals, etc.
    * The best about Qt is that it is completely cross-platform. You write your code on one machine and compile
    it to run for any other architecture. Supported platforms, among others, are Linux, Windows, Android and iOS.

* This project is mainly about the interaction between the Qt framework and standard C++, not about the use
of Qt.
    * While Qt now supports a few different languages, for the purpose of this repository, only C++ is covered.
