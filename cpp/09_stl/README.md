# Standard Template Library (STL)

* The STL is one of my favorite C++ features. Class/reference/exception/etc are useful but not too troublesome to
replicate in C. But speak of STL, it could be really tricky for application developers to reinvent the wheels prepared
by the STL, let alone making the wheels robust and efficient.
    * Well perhaps credit should be given to templates instead, as it is what makes STL possible.

* This sub-project does not intend to cover all the details of STL and it will contain a few possibly confusing
points only.
