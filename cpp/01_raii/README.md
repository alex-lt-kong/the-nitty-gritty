# Resource acquisition is initialization

* RAII is an awkward name for a useful feature. Essentially, it is equivalent
to (if not better than) a `finally` keyword if properly used.

* Let's consider this Python snippet:

    ```python
        try:
            conn = pyodbc.connect(conn_str)
            cursor = conn.cursor()
            # db operations
        except Exception as ex:
            print(ex)
        finally:
            if conn is not None:
                conn.close()
    ```

    * `finally` is needed because we don't want `conn` to be left open whether
    or not an exception is thrown.


* C++'s answer is rather straightforward, let's wrap the resource releasing
in destructor and always call destructor even if an exception is thrown:

    ```C++
        class DatabaseHelper {
        public:
        DatabaseHelper(RawDBConn* rawConn_) : rawConn(rawConn_) {};
        ~DatabaseHelper() {delete rawConn; }
        ... // omitted operator*, etc
        private:
        RawDBConn* rawConn;
        };

        DatabaseHelper handle(createNewResource());
        handle->performInvalidOperation();
    ```

    * The "official" opinion from
    [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#finally)
    also argues that RAII is almost always better than a "finally" keyword.

    * Theoretically, RAII means "to bind the life cycle of a
    resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread
    of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space,
    database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the lifetime
    of an object. ".

    * To be specific, RAII encapsulates each resource into a class, where:
        * the constructor acquires the resource and establishes all class
        invariants or throws an exception if that cannot be done,
        * the destructor releases the resource and never throws exceptions; 


* Similar to Python's Exception raised in `finally` section, if exception
is thrown within destructors, it has to be handled manually. This is beyond
the scope of RAII.
