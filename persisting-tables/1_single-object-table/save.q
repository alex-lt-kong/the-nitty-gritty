/ Just like C, KDB treats string as an array of characters;
/ According to this link, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53640171/kdb-how-to-assign-string-datatype-to-all-columns :
/ KDB does not allow to define column types as list during creation of table.
/ So that means you can not define your column type as String because that is also a list.
/ To circumvent this issue, we define a column `name whose type is left empty
/ then we insert rows to make it a string column

`countries insert (`jp;name:enlist"Japan";100;.z.P)
`countries insert (`us;name:enlist"United States";300;.z.P)
`countries insert (`fr;name:enlist"France";50;.z.P)
show countries
save `countries

/ In SQL, one can declare one or more column(s) of a table as a primary key.
/ This means that the values in the column(s) are unique over the domain of the 
/ rows, making it possible to identify and retrieve a row via its key value. 
/ These two features motivate how q implements a keyed table.
/ In q, key column(s) are placed between the square brackets
/ Note that a keyed table is not a table â€“ it is a dictionary and so has type 99h.
