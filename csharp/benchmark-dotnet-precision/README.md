# BenchmarkDotNet

* BenchmarkDotNet is a useful tool for benchmarking. It makes writing
benchmarks "no harder than writing unit tests!"

* The issue here is: suppose we have two very fast methods (e.g. sub-Î¼s
execution time) and try to benchmark them against each other, if we don't
include an iteration in the benchmarking functions, would the result be
inaccurate due to the accuracy of OS's timing mechanism?
    * For example, Microsoft Windows provides time resolution up to
    [100-nano seconds only](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/acquiring-high-resolution-time-stamps),
    what if we need something much more precise than this to measure execution
    time? Can BenchmarkDotNet still cope?

* The result doesn't seem to be conclusive--guess it implies no performance
penalties?
    * But for a 3.5GHz CPU it executes 3.5 instruction cycles per ns (
i.e., 0.28 ns per cycle), how come BenchmarDotNet reports 2 decimal places for
ns?
