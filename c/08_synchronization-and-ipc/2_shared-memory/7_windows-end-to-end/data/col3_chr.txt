Hello world!
This is the 1st test
HSBC.HK
01234.TW
MSFT or APPL, it doesn't really matter
WHATEVER should be fine, as long as it is shorter than 128 bytes
BUT even if a line is super long, the program will still be running fine without an ArrayOutOfBound error--just characters beyond 128 will be truncated...
!&*(^&*(&*(^*()(~~~!@"""\\\'''??!*^$#)))))(*&^&%)
