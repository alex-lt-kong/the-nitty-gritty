# Shorter integers

* Vectorizing a `uint_8` array instead of a `uint_32` array can boost the performance even further--Intel's SIMD registers
(XMM0â€“XMM7) are 128-bit wide, they can accommodate up to 16 `uint_8` variables but four `uint_32` variables only.

* Results:
```
icc, vectorization on:   618.45ms
icc, vectorization off: 4381.49ms
gcc, vectorization on:   608.03ms
gcc, vectorization off: 4706.47ms
```
