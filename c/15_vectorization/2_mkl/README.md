# Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library

* Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL) is a library of optimized math routines for science,
engineering, and financial applications. The library has C and Fortran interfaces for most routines
on CPU, and DPC++ interfaces for some routines on both CPU and GPU. 

* Intel MKL supports a wide range of calculations, for our purpose, Vector
Mathematical Functions documented [here](ttps://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-mkl-dpcpp-developer-reference/top/vector-mathematical-functions.html)
is something most likely to be useful.
